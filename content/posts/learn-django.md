Recently I have been focusing on learning [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/). Django is a web development framework for Python. There are [many benefits of using Django](https://www.edureka.co/blog/django-tutorial/?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=crosspost&utm_campaign=social-media-edureka-sep-aj#whydjango). It is a very high level framework which means it is quite easy to learn. You get lots of functionality out of box which means it is ideal when you want to make something good real quick.

Below I am sharing the best resources I have come across so far in learning Django. All of these resources are beginner friendly yet they take you through some advance level stuff as well.

## Free Resources

<br>

#### 1. [Django Crash Course by Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6esTdOLXh4&t=1416s)

I like Traversy Media's videos as I learn the best by example. Seeing him code and make a project from scratch explains the concept better than theory alone. In this video Brad makes a simple blogging web app (blogging apps are Hello World of web frameworks I think :) ) This is not a full featured tutorial, rather a quick overview.

<br>

#### 2. [Python Django Tutorial by Corey Schafer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmljXZIypDc&list=PL-osiE80TeTtoQCKZ03TU5fNfx2UY6U4p)

This is another tutorial to make a basic blogging app using Django. But this one goes into a lot more detail. Corey Schafer is an excellent YouTube teacher and I have leraned a lot from his Python tutorials. So do check this playlist out.

<br>

#### 3. [MDN Django Tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django)

Mozilla Developers' Network has a hands-on tutorial for Django where you read the easy to follow tutorial and make your own Local Library website, an online catalog for a small local library, where users can browse available books and manage their accounts. After you follow the tutorial till the end try making another website like this with some variations and see if you can figure it out.
