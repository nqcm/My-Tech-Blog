I used to run a free coding club for kids where we learnt Scratch, HTML, CSS, and Python. Plus I am a self taught person and I learnt Python, among other things, completely on my own.

So it's no wonder that I have a huge collection of resources to learn Python.

Here are some of the resources I have used personally and in my coding club.

### [Twilio Quest - Mysteries of the Pythonic Temple](https://www.twilio.com/quest/learn/python)

A game which teaches setting up Python on your computer abd basics of the language.

### [Projects from Raspberry Pi](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects?software%5B%5D=python)

Some kid friendly projects to practice the basics. It also includes projects where you can learn Python by using it to program with micro controllers and Raspberry Pi.

### [Invent your own computer games with Python](https://inventwithpython.com/#invent)

Invent Your Own Computer Games with Python teaches you how to program in the Python language. Each chapter gives you the complete source code for a new game, and then teaches the programming concepts from the examples.

### [Encrypt messages and hack cyphers with Python](https://inventwithpython.com/#cracking)

Cracking Codes with Python teaches complete beginners how to program in the Python programming language. The book features the source code to several ciphers and hacking programs for these ciphers.

### [Python for Everybody](https://www.py4e.com/)

This one is an open course and may be suitable for older kids. But Dr. Chuck is am amazing teacher and this course builds the foundation.

### [Python on CodeAcademy](https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/language/python)

I personally am not a huge fan of codeacademy, but many people like it.

### [Learn Python the Hard Way] (https://learnpythonthehardway.org/python3/)

Another book which builds good foundation, although its a bit boring üò¥

### [Object-oriented Programming in Python: Create Your Own Adventure Game](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/object-oriented-principles)

Learn object-oriented programming principles by creating your own text-based adventure game in Python. I really enjoyed learning/teaching with this course. As it explains the object oriented programming principles in a easy to understand and engaging manner.

### [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/?language=python)

Finally you can practice your skills with codewars. Or read on for my preferred way to practice üëá

### [A List of Python Projects You Can Build](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/python-projects-for-beginners/)

My preferred way of practicing what I have learnt, and taking my understanding further is to make stuff. This site gives some good projects ideas which are suitable for beginners.
